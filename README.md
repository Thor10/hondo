# Hondo

_A game in 100 words or less._

Hondo is a word-guessing game where the more words you guess in a row, the more points you get. The goal is to get to score a Hondo (100 points) in as few turns as possible. 

Watch out, though: every guess costs energy, and if you run out, the game is over. Restore energy by guessing correctly.

To help out, you have access to Shuffles and Skips to alter the game and tilt the odds in your favor. But use them wisely; they both cost precious energy.


## The code

Hondo is made using SvelteKit. To run Hondo locally, download or clone this repo, and run:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

There are definitely bits of the code that could be better (especially the TypeScript parts) but I've tried to keep it fairly well organized and consistent.
